# What's new in v4.0.0

_tl;dr_

- The NPM packages have been simplified
- New ESLint plugins provide an automated migration path - (using the ESLint --fix flag)
- Functionality and dependencies have not changed

This should make Source easier to consume and contribute to

## Package structure

Previously, the foundations of our visual design language (colours, spacing, typography) were published in `@guardian/src-foundations`. They were accompanied by a set of React components that were published **individually**, following a `@guardian/src-*` naming system.

In v4, `@guardian/src-foundations` is replaced by `@guardian/source-foundations`, and all the React components are published together in a **single new package** called `@guardian/source-react-components`.

### Example

```ts
// v3
import { from } from '@guardian/src-foundations/mq';
import { text } from '@guardian/src-foundations/palette';
import { headline } from '@guardian/src-foundations/typography';
import { Hide } from '@guardian/src-layout';
import { Link } from '@guardian/src-link';

const Links = () => (
	<div
		css={css`
			color: ${text.primary};
			${from.desktop} {
				${headline.medium()};
			}
		`}
	>
		<Hide until="tablet">
			<Link href="#">Click here</Link>
		</Hide>
	</div>
);
```

```ts
// v4
import { from, headline, text } from '@guardian/source-foundations';
import { Hide, Link } from '@guardian/source-react-components';

const Links = () => (
	<div
		css={css`
			color: ${text.primary};
			${from.desktop} {
				${headline.medium()};
			}
		`}
	>
		<Hide until="tablet">
			<Link href="#">Click here</Link>
		</Hide>
	</div>
);
```

### Summary

| Versions | Design Foundations             | Components                                            |
| :------- | :----------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| `3.*`    | `@guardian/src-foundations`    | `@guardian/src-accordion`, `@guardian/src-brand` etc… |
| `4.0.0`  | `@guardian/source-foundations` | `@guardian/source-react-components`                   |

#### A note on package versions

`@guardian/source-foundations` and `@guardian/source-react-components` start at `4.0.0` to maintain the current version numbering.

However, unlike before, _their version numbers will not stay in sync going forward_. Instead, packages like `source-react-components` that depend on `source-foundations` should declare the version they need in their `peerDependencies`.

> Components change more frequently than the fundamentals of our design, and it seems odd to bump the foundations package because a component in a different package has changed (especially if you were only using the foundations package in the first place).

## ESLint plugins

Two new ESLint plugins accompany this release that contain Source-specific linting rules that are highly recommended for your project:

- `@guardian/eslint-plugin-source-foundations`
- `@guardian/eslint-plugin-source-react-components`

They can also be used to migrate your project to v4 automatically, using ESLint’s `--fix` option.

### Migrating to v4

- Uninstall all `@guardian/src-*` packages
- Install the new packages (as required):
  - `@guardian/source-foundations`
  - `@guardian/source-react-components`
- Install the new ESLint plugins (as required) as `devDependencies`:

  - `@guardian/eslint-plugin-source-foundations`
  - `@guardian/eslint-plugin-source-react-components`

- Add the relevant configs for your project: [@guardian/eslint-plugin-source-foundations](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/packages-eslint-plugin-source-foundations-readme--page) or [@guardian/eslint-plugin-source-react-components](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/packages-eslint-plugin-source-react-components-readme--page)
- Run eslint with the [`--fix` option](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface#fixing-problems)

#### Example

```js
// .eslintrc.js
"extends": [
	...,
	"plugin:@guardian/source-foundations/recommended",
	"plugin:@guardian/source-react-components/recommended"
],
```

### Manual migration

We recommend following the steps above however it is also possible to migrate manually. On the whole, migration involves updating import statements for `@guardian/src-*` to either `@guardian/source-foundations` or `@guardian/source-react-components`. Some further changes may be required in specific cases (see below).

## Other changes

We minimised other changes to keep migration as simple as possible, but some house-keeping was required.

Note: To conform with the Guardian's [NPM package recommendations](https://github.com/guardian/recommendations/blob/main/npm-packages.md#using-guardian-npm-packages), we [removed an inline polyfill](https://github.com/guardian/source/pull/982/files#diff-1d4bbfb57a73b4844eea8bf903faf617deb06f41c4d06c05e835eb82d2ebaa68L30-L49) for `Object.fromEntries`. If you support [IE11 or another unsupported browser](https://caniuse.com/mdn-javascript_builtins_object_fromentries), you will need to provide a polyfill for this method.
