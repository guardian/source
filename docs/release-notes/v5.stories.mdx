# What's new in v5.0.0

_tl;dr_

- Accessibility improvements (some components look different)
- Component APIs have not changed
- Functionality and dependencies have not changed

This brings Source closer to WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

## Migrating to v5

From a code perspective, v5 of Source is a drop-in replacement for v4. There are no
breaking API changes and functionality has not changed.

There are a number of updates that change the way Source components appear. There are
also some colour changes. Consumers are advised to ensure the Source components
and colours still look beautiful and accessible within their products.

If a changed component or colour appears in automated visual regression tests (e.g. in
Chromatic), please review the changes before upgrading Source.

## Changes

### Identifying Links and Buttons

Links and Buttons are distinctively identified as interactive elements by applying
an underline to the text.

- Deprecate `subdued` styling in `<Link>` component.
- Give all links (including now-deprecated `subdued`) an underline.
- Increase the thickness of the `<Link>` component's underline on hover
- Give text-only `<Button>` components (`priority="subdued"`) an underline which increases in thickness on hover
- Add a small amount of spacing between the `<Button>` and the focus outline

### Colour

Our text colours are optimised to have a 4.5:1 contrast ratio against their background.

For graphical objects and user interface components (e.g. icons, infographics and buttons),
we aim for a 3:1 contrast ratio against its background.
