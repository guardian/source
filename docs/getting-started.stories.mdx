# Getting started

> Installing our shared components and foundations.

## Welcome! 🤗 🎊 🤝

Thank you for looking at the Source docs! We love feedback, so if you have any questions or suggestions regarding this site or Source in general, please [get in touch](https://theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/231f6b-contact-us) ✉️.

## Packages

Our library for the web consists of three packages:

1. `@guardian/source-foundations` – the foundations for our design system.
1. `@guardian/source-react-components` – a set of robust, accessible React components implemented using the foundations.
1. `@guardian/source-react-components-development-kitchen` – an experimental set of React components for development and testing.

## Install

Our library for the web lives in the [Source repository](https://github.com/guardian/source). It is written in TypeScript.

We recommend using Yarn to manage dependencies. We also support NPM, but for brevity our documentation will assume you are using Yarn.

This guide assumes you have some familiarity with React and Babel. Setting up a React project from scratch is outside the scope of this guide.

We recommend installing the following packages:

-   `react`
-   `@emotion/react`
-   `@guardian/src-foundations`

```shell
$ yarn add react@^17.0.1 @emotion/react@^11.1.2 @guardian/src-foundations
```

> See [Using Emotion](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/docs-04-using-emotion--page) for guidance on how to configure Babel to use Emotion's css prop.

## Foundations

Foundations are the atoms from which all our visual design is built. They are intended for use with a CSS-in-JS library such as [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

```shell
$ yarn add @guardian/source-foundations
```

For more details, see the [Foundations page](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=foundations--page) and the packages in `source-foundations`.

## Components

We publish individually installable components built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

```shell
$ yarn add @guardian/source-react-components
```

For more details, see the [Components page](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=components--page) and the packages in `source-react-components`.

> You must also install `react`, `@emotion/react` and `@guardian/source-foundations` to use our components
