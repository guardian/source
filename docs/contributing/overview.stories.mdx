# Contributing

> How to contribute to the Source Design System for developers.

## Local development

Install dependencies using Yarn:

```shell
$ yarn
```

Develop using Storybook:

```shell
$ yarn storybook
```

## Guidelines

### Creating new components

-   New components should be added to the [Development Kitchen](https://github.com/guardian/source/tree/main/packages/%40guardian/source-react-components-development-kitchen).
-   New components must have a CODEOWNER.

### Using Emotion

-   First familiarise yourself with Emotion's documentation â€“ we use [the React flavour](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction#react)
-   Prefer composing styles using the `css` tag and the `css` prop.
-   Avoid using `styled` to create or extend components.
    -   Every styled component rendered creates an additional `Context.Consumer` component, which can lead to [performance issues](https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2019/the-unseen-performance-costs-of-css-in-js-in-react-apps/).
-   <em>Avoid dynamic styles</em>. Prefer using conditional logic in the
    component to compose numerous small chunks of CSS using the `css` prop.
-   One example of unavoidable dynamic styles is Theming.

### Themes

-   Ensure each variant of the component works against the [default theme](https://www.theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/1377a6-themes/b/293ddb).
    -   Some components may also need to work against [core brand](https://www.theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/1377a6-themes/b/4893db) and [alternative brand](https://www.theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/1377a6-themes/b/21c6cc) backgrounds.
-   Theme colours should be added to a corresponding module under packages/@guardian/src-foundations/src/themes. These are passed to the `<ThemeProvider>`, and subsequently down to the component via the `css` prop.
-   Ensure the theme package only contains theme-related colours. Some colours may apply to all themes. These should be defined in the component package, in `styles.tsx`.

### Documentation

-   To enable better integration with our documentation site, each component variant should be represented as a separate story at its own URL.

### Testing

-   Ensure you test your changes against our [accessibility testing guide](https://github.com/guardian/source/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md#accessibility).
-   Ensure your component works against the following browsers (you can [ask for access to Browserstack](mailto:devx@theguardian.com?subject=Browserstack login)):
    -   **Chrome 77+**
    -   **Firefox 68+**
    -   **Edge 17+**
    -   **Safari 12+**
    -   **IE11**
-   Ensure your component can be imported and server-rendered on a project running **Node.js v10**.
-   Ensure your component works on touchscreen devices.

### Commits

-   Before raising a pull request, we request that you squash your commits. We prefer to see as few commits as possible as it makes the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/guardian/source/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) (slightly) more readable.
-   Each commit should contain changes to exactly one package. If you need to edit multiple packages as part of a change, please divide these into separate commits. Again, this is for CHANGELOG readability.
-   Commit messages should read as if you are instructing someone else what to do. It usually helps to start with a verb. For example, "Increase the line height of the body text".

### Raising a pull request

-   Generate a changeset describing your work by running `yarn changeset` and following the prompts.
-   Test that your component can be used in a real project (e.g. [dotcom-rendering](https://github.com/guardian/dotcom-rendering)). Use [`yarn link`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/link) to avoid having to perform a real publish, and [`yarn pack`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/pack) to see exactly which files would be published.
-   If your change extends the API of a component or the foundations (e.g. you are adding a new component, a new prop or exporting a new type), please update the [package validation tests](https://github.com/guardian/source/tree/main/scripts/validate-dist).

## Publishing

Publishing is triggered by merging the auto-generated _Version Packages_ PR that changesets manages.

### Publishing src-\* (legacy) packages

It is no longer possible to publish legacy packages from the head of the main
branch. You will first need to check out the most recent v3.x tag.

To publish `src-*` packages that have changed since the last release, you should
first run:

```sh
$ yarn verbump:prerelease:src
```

Changes should be committed to git. This ensures all `src-*` packages have
changed and will be updated at the same time with the same version number. You
may then run:

```sh
$ yarn release
```

### Force publishing unchanged packages

There are times when you want to publish a new version of a package even
when the package source code hasn't changed. In these cases, you should:

-   create a new changeset
-   create a PR explaining why the package needs to be bumped
