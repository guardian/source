# Overriding styles

There are a number of ways to extend or override the styles of Source components.

## Creating a custom theme

If you plan to override the colours of several components in a similar way, consider building a [custom theme](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/docs-05-theming--page).

## Using `css` from `@emotion/react`

You can pass `SerializedStyles` generated by the `css` function to the `cssOverrides` prop.

```jsx
import { css } from '@emotion/react';

const danger = css`
	background-colour: ${error[500]};
	color: ${text.ctaPrimary};

	&:hover {
		background-colour: ${error[400]};
	}
`(<Button cssOverrides={danger}>Delete my account</Button>);
```

The `cssOverrides` prop is mixed into the `css` prop for the main element of the component. This differs from component to component. You'll need to look at the source `index.tsx` file for the component to see where your overrides will be applied.

> **Request for comments:** we are thinking of ways to improve this API. Please [comment on this issue](https://github.com/guardian/source/issues/306) if you have any suggestions, or if you have noticed limitations when trying to override styles on a particular component.

## Using classNames

If you are using vanilla `emotion` or another CSS solution that relies on passing the `className` prop, you can pass your `className` to the Source component as normal.

One caveat here is that `@emotion/react`, which Source components use for styling, appends style tags to the bottom of the document head. Since they appear at the end of the cascade, they tend to override other styles unless the other styles have a higher specificity.

**You may therefore need to mark overrides as** `!important` **in order to ensure they are applied.**
