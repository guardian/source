# Theming

By default, all components are styled using their light theme.

To apply a different theme, we recommend using [Emotion's theming API](https://emotion.sh/docs/theming). You can import the desired theme from `@guardian/source-react-components`

To compose a theme for specific components:

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import {
	Button,
	buttonThemeBrand,
	TextInput,
	textInputThemeBrand,
} from '@guardian/source-react-components';

const Form = () => (
	<ThemeProvider theme={{ ...buttonThemeBrand, ...textInputThemeBrand }}>
		<form>
			<TextInput label="First Name" />
			<Button>Click me</Button>
		</form>
	</ThemeProvider>
);
```

## Available themes

Standard themes available from `@guardian/source-react-components`:

-   **default – exported as `[componentName]ThemeDefault`**
-   **brand – exported as `[componentName]ThemeBrand`**
-   **brandAlt – exported as `[componentName]ThemeBrandAlt`**

For a preview of how these themes look, visit the [colour tokens section](https://theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/1377a6-tokens/b/293ddb) of the colour guide.

To find out which themes a component supports, check its stories under `Packages/source-react-components/<ComponentName>`

Note that some components have their own unique themes in addition to the standard set of themes. For instance, the button component defines [two themes for use in Reader Revenue flows](https://theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/435225-button/t/41a3ce).

## Custom themes

If you plan to override the styles of several components in a similar way, consider building a custom theme.

Themes are JavaScript object literals that expose a groups of colour properties.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@emotion/react';
import { text, background } from '@guardian/source-foundations';
import { Button, Link } from '@guardian/source-react-components';

const customTheme = {
	button: {
		textPrimary: text.ctaPrimary,
		backgroundPrimary: background.ctaPrimary,
		backgroundPrimaryHover: background.ctaPrimaryHover,
		textSecondary: text.ctaSecondary,
		backgroundSecondary: background.ctaSecondary,
		backgroundSecondaryHover: background.ctaSecondaryHover,
	},
	link: {
		textPrimary: text.anchorPrimary,
		textPrimaryHover: text.anchorPrimary,
		textSecondary: text.anchorSecondary,
		textSecondaryHover: text.anchorSecondary,
	},
};

const Form = () => (
	<ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
		<form>
			<Button>Click me</Button>
			<Link href="/">Go back</Link>
		</form>
	</ThemeProvider>
);
```

To see which properties can be themed, take a look in the
`packages/@guardian/source-react-components/src/<ComponentName>/theme.ts` file for the
component you are theming.
