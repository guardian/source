# Getting started

> Installing our shared components and foundations.

## Welcome! 🤗 🎊 🤝

Thank you for looking at the Source docs! We love feedback, so if you have any questions or suggestions regarding this site or Source in general, please [get in touch](https://theguardian.design/2a1e5182b/p/231f6b-contact-us) ✉️.

Our library for the web lives in the [Source repository](https://github.com/guardian/source). It is written in TypeScript, but you can still use our code even if your application is written in JavaScript.

We recommend using Yarn to manage dependencies. We also support NPM, but for brevity our documentation will assume you are using Yarn.

This guide assumes you have some familiarity setting up React projects using TypeScript or Babel.

## Foundations

Foundations are the atoms from which all our visual design is built. They are intended for use with a CSS-in-JS library such as [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

```shell
$ yarn add @guardian/source-foundations
```

For more details, see the [Foundations docs](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/docs-02-foundations--page).

## Components

We publish individually installable components built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/).

```shell
$ yarn add @guardian/source-react-components
```

For more details, see the [Components docs](https://guardian.github.io/source/?path=/docs/docs-03-components--page).

> You must also install `react`, `@emotion/react` and `@guardian/source-foundations` to use our components
