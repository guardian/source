It may be useful to toggle this flag when there is limited space.

_Note: the up or down chevron icon always appears._

## AccordionRow Props

**`string`**

A line of text to summarise the information that lies within the expanded state.
Appears in the collapsed state, as well as prominantly at the top of the expanded state.
