# Packages

This is where all `source` packages will eventually live. `src/core` will be migrated to `packages/source` and we will just publish `@guardian/editorial` and `@guardian/source`.

Until migration is complete, the `.eslintrc.json` and `tsconfig.json` files in here are just to avoid changing anything to do with the current `src/core` setup.

Config files should live at the top level and apply to all packages eventually.
