    );
};
```

## `ChoiceCardGroup` Props

### `name`

**`string`**

Gets passed as the name attribute for each choice card

### `label`

**`string`**

Set as the legend for the fieldset

### `supporting`

**`string`**

Additional text that appears below the `label`

### `multi`

**`boolean`** _= false_

If true, users may select more than one choice card (checkbox behaviour). By default, users
may only select a single choice card (radio button behaviour).

### `columns`

**`number`**

To render a grid of choice cards, specify the number of columns. If this prop is not set, cards will appear on a single line.

### `error`

**`string`**

If passed, error styling should applies to this choice card group. The string appears as an inline error message.

## `ChoiceCard` Props

### `label`

**`ReactNode`**

Appears inside the choice card

### `supporting`

**`ReactNode`**

Additional text or a component that appears below the label

### `icon`

**`ReactElement`**

An icon that appears inside the button, alongside text

### `checked`

**`boolean`**

Whether choice card is checked. This is necessary when using the [controlled approach](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components) to form state management.

**Note:** if you pass the `checked` prop, you **must** also pass an `onChange` handler, or the field will be rendered as read-only.

## Supported themes
