# CSS reset

Source provides an optional CSS reset that sets some sensible default CSS rules. The intention is to provide a base for a consistent environment across projects and browsers.

The reset is minimal and is optional for consumers of Source. In a future major version upgrade, consuming the reset will become mandatory for consumers of Source. To get ahead of the game, we recommend trying to consume them today.

## Example

```tsx
import { resets } from '@guardian/source-foundations';

const document = () => (
	<html>
		<head>
			<style>{resets.resetCSS}</style>
		</head>
		<body>{/* â€¦ */}</body>
	</html>
);
```
