Adds an `isLoading` prop to the Button component. This replaces any icon rendered on the button with a spinner (`SvgSpinner`). The spinner will have colours that match the background and text colours of the button. The Button `disabled` state is also extended to show a `not-allowed` cursor and set the opacity to 0.4 so that the disabled state is indicated visually"
